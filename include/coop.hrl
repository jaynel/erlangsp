%% A Co-op is a graph of process clusters, split into a Co-op Head and Co-op Body
%% A Co-op Head receives incoming data and feeds it to the Co-op Body
%% Co-op Nodes withing the Co-op Body are linked into a directed graph upon which the data flows
%% Each Co-op Node executes a task function on the data that flows in, passing the result onward

%% A Co-op is a static Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) template and a collection of Co-op Instances
